# Project 1
## Vulnerability Management
> In this project I set up a practiced host scannning, vulnerability scan, view found vulenerabilities, and generating a report with Tenable Nessus
> 

#### Software/Tools used in lab

*   Kali Linux
*   Metasploitable 2
*   Tenable Nessus


For this project I wanted to mess around and learn about some Vulnerability Management tools. Tenable Nessus was always a tool that I've seen people bring up
when talking about Vulnerability Management so I decided to give it a try. I already have had a Kali VM created but in order to actually test Nessus I needed an attack Machine and that's why I had created a Metaspoitable 2 VM. Creating a VM is kind of striaght forward, especially for what I need, so I won't go through all of those seps. But, I will walk you through setting up Tenable Nessus and learning what I can do with it.

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
